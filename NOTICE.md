# NOTICE — third-party provenance

posterly is **MIT © 2026 Ruishuo Chen** (see `LICENSE`). It additionally vendors a set of
poster-quality "gate" tools, three tokenized templates, and one component catalog from **ARIS**
(Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep), whose `paper-poster-html` skill is itself a fork of
posterly. This file records the vendor boundary so the relationship stays clean and
attribution is preserved in both directions.

## Vendored from ARIS (MIT)

- **Upstream**: ARIS — https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep
  (skill `paper-poster-html`).
- **License**: MIT, © 2026 wanshuiyin. Full text: `LICENSES/aris-MIT.txt`.
- **Note on lineage**: ARIS's `paper-poster-html` vendored posterly's render/measure engine
  (`_posterly/`, `poster_check.py`, `render_preview.py`) unchanged, then layered the gate
  tools below on top. We vendor those ARIS-original additions back here. posterly keeps its
  **own** (newer) `_posterly/` and `poster_check.py` — they are NOT replaced.

Vendored, **body unmodified** (a provenance header comment was prepended to each `.py`):

| Path | Origin in ARIS | Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------|
| `tools/style_check.py` | `scripts/style_check.py` | style HARD gate (12 rules: token-only colors, no inline `style=`, no gradients, font whitelist, `--fs-*` scale, data-attribute contracts) |
| `tools/asset_check.py` | `scripts/asset_check.py` | real-figure provenance gate (`data-source="paper"` + `FIGURE_MANIFEST.json` sha256 chain + rendered-area bands) |
| `tools/extract_pdf_figures.py` | `scripts/extract_pdf_figures.py` | pull real figures out of a paper PDF (contact-sheet / auto / crop) — needs PyMuPDF + Pillow |
| `tools/preprocess_figures.py` | `scripts/preprocess_figures.py` | autocrop / resolution-check extracted crops, keep `FIGURE_MANIFEST.json` honest — needs Pillow |

These vendored scripts import posterly's own `tools/_posterly/` (canvas/render/textutil),
so they run against posterly's engine, not a copy.

Vendored and **adapted**:

| Path | Origin | posterly modifications |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| `templates/COMPONENTS.md` | `templates/COMPONENTS.md` | re-pointed from the ARIS skill's design docs to posterly's `SKILL.md` + `tools/` gates; provenance note added. The component classes it catalogs are posterly's own. |
| `templates/landscape_4col_neutral.html` | `templates/landscape_4col.html` | the **tokenized** form of posterly's own neutral template — replaced the non-tokenized original in place so `style_check` passes out of the box; provenance comment prepended. Measure-role skeleton, component classes, and placeholder copy are posterly's own (verified identical). |
| `templates/landscape_hero_neutral.html` | `templates/landscape_hero.html` | same as above |
| `templates/portrait_2col_neutral.html` | `templates/portrait_2col.html` | same as above |
| `tools/run_gates.py` | `scripts/run_gates.py` | gate orchestrator → `GATE_REPORT.json`. **Modified by posterly** (fixes an upstream false-pass): the asset gate is now opt-in — without `--manifest` it is reported `NOT_RUN` and excluded from `overall`, instead of being run, crashing on its required arg (child exit 2), and silently counted as a pass; a hard gate that ends in SKIPPED from a real environment error now counts as a failure. Also forwards `--hero` to `asset_check`; the report `skill` field is `posterly`. |

## ARIS-inspired, original posterly work (not a copy)

- The **softened closed-set fix vocabulary** and the **cross-model final-review** step in
  `SKILL.md` are original posterly text, inspired by `paper-poster-html`'s DESIGN_FINAL
  (Phase 5 anti-patch-loop / Phase 6 Codex review). posterly's version is half-closed (the
  agent may *propose* a new token/variant for human review rather than being hard-blocked)
  and uses adjustable round caps, suited to a human-in-the-loop workflow.

## Not vendored

ARIS's venue color-token packs (`templates/tokens/*.json`) were intentionally **not** taken:
posterly derives its palette from poster signals (logo / figure / brand) under WCAG AA,
rather than from fixed per-venue presets.

## Upstream-sync rule

When pulling new ARIS releases of these tools, preserve the vendor boundary: re-vendor the
body-unmodified `.py` files (`style_check.py`, `asset_check.py`, `extract_pdf_figures.py`,
`preprocess_figures.py`) as drop-in replacements (re-prepend the provenance header), and
re-apply the documented `COMPONENTS.md` + template adaptations. **`run_gates.py` is not a
drop-in**: re-apply posterly's asset-opt-in / no-silent-false-pass patch on top of the new
upstream version. Do not fold posterly-specific logic into the body-unmodified files, so the
ARIS diff stays clean and re-syncable.
