"""Chromium-gated integration test for the CARD/TRAILING geometry inside
``polish``'s ``_POLISH_JS``.

The unit tests in ``test_polish_output.py`` feed the Python loop canned
``cards`` data and never execute the JS, so the DOM-geometry sampling
itself -- text-node ``Range`` measurement, absolutely-positioned-subtree
skip, and ``border-bottom`` subtraction -- is only exercised here, against
a real headless Chromium. These three were the substance of a review of
the original leaf-element scan, which:

  * undershot ``maxB`` when a plain-text tail wrapped below an inline
    ``<span>``/``<b>`` (the parent had element children, so it was skipped,
    and the inline leaf sat on an earlier line) -> FALSE POSITIVE;
  * was pulled to the card bottom by an absolutely-positioned corner
    badge, masking a real top-packed void above it -> FALSE NEGATIVE.

Skipped when Playwright/Chromium isn't installed (e.g. the mocked unit
suite runs under a plain interpreter with no browser).
