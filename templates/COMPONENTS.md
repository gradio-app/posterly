# Component contract catalog

> **Provenance.** This catalog was authored by ARIS (skill `paper-poster-html`, MIT © 2026
> wanshuiyin) on top of posterly's own component classes, and vendored back into posterly — see
> `../NOTICE.md`. Section references of the form *DESIGN_FINAL §N* / *IMPLEMENTATION_CONVENTIONS
> §N* point to that upstream skill's design docs (**not shipped here**); in posterly the
> equivalent rules live in `SKILL.md` (the visual-review loop + fix vocabulary) and the gate
> scripts under `tools/` — treat the §refs as historical pointers, not files you can open. Any
> remaining *Phase N* wording maps to posterly's `SKILL.md` Steps: Phase 1 → Step 1.5 (content
> audit), Phase 3 → Step 3 (scaffold), Phase 5 → Step 6 (visual / polish loop), Phase 6 → Step 6.5
> (final review).

This is the **authoritative component set** for posterly. The visual-review loop and the fix
vocabulary (see `SKILL.md`) may only touch components listed here. A component that is not in
this catalog **does not exist** as far as the loop is concerned: see
[New components require a checkpoint](#new-components-require-a-human-checkpoint).

Why this file is load-bearing: the anti-pattern loop in poster authoring is "agent invents a
new visual element to fix one issue, the element brings its own hex / inline style / extra hue,
the next gate flags *that*, the agent invents another element…". Pinning the component set turns
every fix into a bounded edit (swap a known component, flip a known variant, retune a token)
instead of unbounded markup invention. COMPONENTS.md is what makes fix vocabulary item (b)
("whole-instance swap/add/delete, component set drawn from COMPONENTS.md") well-defined.

These component classes are posterly's own (© 2026 Ruishuo Chen — AGPL-3.0 as part of posterly).
The ARIS fork that wrote
this catalog only de-gradients them, tokenizes their colors/sizes, and strips inline `style=`;
class names did not change, so the catalog applies to posterly's templates directly.

## How to read each entry

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Purpose** | The single job this component does. If your content needs a different job, you need a *different* component, not a restyled one. |
| **Allowed variants** | Predefined modifier classes only. Adding an undeclared variant = fix-vocabulary violation. |
| **Required data attributes** | Attributes a gate keys off. Omitting them breaks a gate (usually `measure` or `asset_check`). |
| **Token usage** | Which `--*` tokens the component's CSS references. Component CSS may **only** name colors via `var(--…)` (style_check rule 3). |
| **Inspected by** | Which gate(s) read this component. Tells you which gate a bad edit will trip. |
| **Allowed fix operations** | Subset of the fix-vocabulary letters `(a)–(g)` (defined in [Fix vocabulary](#fix-vocabulary) below) legal on this component. |
| **Anti-patterns** | Specific things the loop has been caught doing. Each maps to a HARD style/asset rule, a rubric cap, or (for the disabled rule 4/5 cases) the catalog convention noted above. |

Gate name shorthand (DESIGN_FINAL §3–§7):
`preflight` (structure), `style` (`style_check.py`, 13 rules), `asset` (`asset_check.py`),
`measure` (`poster_check.py measure`, column/footer/canvas geometry),
`polish` (`poster_check.py polish`, figure-AR / orphan / whitespace).

> **posterly default — style rules 4 & 5 are OFF.** posterly runs `style_check` with rules
> **4 (≤2 non-neutral hue families)** and **5 (no gradients)** disabled (`run_gates.py` forwards
> `--style-disable 4,5`) — palette breadth and gradients are the author's call. So the
> per-component "rule 4" / "rule 5" notes below describe the catalog **convention** (the templates
> ship ≤2 hue families and flat fills, and keeping them that way is the recommended default), not
> a hard failure — they only hard-fail if you re-enable them with `--style-disable ''`. The other
> 11 rules (token-only colors, no inline `style=`, the font/size scale, the data-attribute and
> variant-class contracts) stay HARD.

## card

- **Purpose**: The atomic content unit inside a column — holds one section's prose, list,
  figure, equation, table, or callout. Everything in the body lives in a card.
- **Allowed variants**: `.card.highlight` (accent left-bar + tinted emphasis, for the most
  important card in a column), `.card.tinted` (subtle `--bg-card-tint` fill), `.card--compact`
  (predefined tighter padding variant — fix vocabulary (f)). No other modifiers.
- **Required data attributes**: `data-measure-role="card"` (every card; `measure` aligns card
  bottoms across columns using this).
- **Token usage**: `--bg-card`, `--bg-card-tint`, `--bg-emphasis`, `--accent` (highlight
  left-bar / border-strong), `--border-soft`, `--text-primary`. Shadow uses a token-derived
  rgba allowed by style rule 5 only at alpha ≤ 0.06.
- **Inspected by**: `measure` (card-bottom spread < 5px, intercard gap 12–50 HARD), `polish`
  (CARD/TRAILING — a single card stretched with blank space below its content), `preflight`
  (valid role), `style` (no inline style, colors via var).
- **Allowed fix operations**: (a) token retune, (b) move/add/delete a whole card across columns,
  (c) content rebalance inside the card, (e) global card stylesheet change (tokens only),
  (f) switch to `.card--compact` / `.card.highlight` / `.card.tinted`.
- **Anti-patterns**: inline `style="background:#…"` on a card to "make it pop" (style rule 1/2);
  padding a card with blank lines to fill column height instead of moving content (measure
  intercard-gap HARD fail / polish CARD/TRAILING, rubric "half-empty card" cap ≤5); a fourth highlight per column (dilutes
  the single-accent discipline, rubric ≤4 if it adds a hue family).

## numbered-card (`.card` + `.section-title` with `.num`)

- **Purpose**: A `card` whose header is a numbered section title — the standard reading order
  cue ("1 Motivation", "2 Method"…). Not a separate element: it is `.card` containing
  `<div class="section-title"><span class="num">N</span><span class="st-text">Title</span></div>`.
  **The title text — and any ★ marker — MUST sit inside the `.st-text` span.** That is what lets
  a long heading wrap as natural text with a hanging indent. Without the wrapper the round number
  badge gets stranded on its own line and the title is pushed below it, because a flex/`:has`
  fallback then floats the badge (graceful, but not the intended centred form). Do not insert a
  manual `<br>` to force a break; let `.st-text` wrap on its own.
- **Allowed variants**: inherits all `card` variants. The `.section-title` may carry a small
  inline gold "★ KEY" / "★ Headline" marker as the **last child of `.st-text`**, glued to the
  preceding word with `&nbsp;` (e.g. `…Result&nbsp;<span class="key-mark">&#9733; KEY</span>`) so
  it can never widow onto its own line. Use the template's gold marker class (`.key-mark` in
  landscape_4col, `.tag-key` in portrait) — never an inline `style="color:…"`.
- **Required data attributes**: same as `card` (`data-measure-role="card"`). The number itself
  carries no data attribute.
- **Token usage**: `.section-title` → `--accent-deep` (text), `--font-sans`; `.num` →
  `--accent` background, white text. Font-size via `--fs-7` (section title) and `--fs-5` (.num).
- **Inspected by**: `measure`, `preflight`, `style` (font pairing rule 6 — section title must be
  the sans stack; rule 8 — font-size via `--fs-*`).
- **Allowed fix operations**: (a), (b), (c), (e), (f). Renumbering is content rebalance (c).
- **Anti-patterns**: section title rendered in the serif body stack (rule 6 HARD); a per-title
  font-size override in px (rule 8 HARD); decorative inline SVG icon next to the number instead
  of the `.num` circle (rule 11 HARD — no homemade decorative SVG).

## figure-card (`.card` containing `.figure`)

- **Purpose**: A card whose payload is a paper figure: `.figure > img + .caption`. The primary
  carrier of real, paper-sourced images (the thing `asset_check` exists to enforce).
- **Allowed variants**: `.figure--wide` (predefined, image spans full card width — fix (f));
  the `<img>` width is set with the utility classes `.w-45 … .w-100` (5% steps), never inline,
  **except** the one sanctioned inline exception below.
- **Required data attributes** (only when you adopt the figure-provenance gate — see `SKILL.md`
  "Real-figure provenance gate"; the core flow does **not** require them):
  - On the `<img>`: `data-source="paper"` **and** `data-asset-id="<manifest id>"`. These are a
    **pair** — `style_check` rule 10 hard-fails an `<img data-source="paper">` that lacks
    `data-asset-id`, so never add one without the other (and if you're not running the asset
    gate, add neither). When the gate runs, the asset id must exist in `FIGURE_MANIFEST.json`
    with `from_paper:true`.
  - Optional `data-fig-layout="beside-text"` on the `<img>` to opt the figure out of the
    AR-width gate when it legitimately shares its card with a meaningful text column
    (DESIGN_FINAL §10 (g) territory; polish honors it).
  - Sanctioned inline style: `data-source="paper"` `<img>` may carry **only**
    `style="width: NN%"` for aspect-ratio width tuning (B-contract exception); prefer the
    `.w-NN` utility class when the value lands on a 5% step.
- **Token usage**: `.figure img` border → `--border-soft`; `.caption` → `--text-secondary`,
  `--accent-deep` (caption `<strong>`); caption font-size `--fs-3`/`--fs-2`.
- **Inspected by**: `asset` (≥2 paper figures, per-figure area **1.5–13%** body, total **12–28%**
  body [warn >24%, target ~14–22%; `--hero` raises the per-figure cap to 42%], natural_px ≥1.5×
  rendered, manifest fields + sha256 — an *oversized* figure hard-fails too), `polish` (figure AR sizing:
  FIG/WIDE / FIG/SQUARE / FIG/TALL / FIG/BROKEN), `style` (rule 10 contract attrs; rule 4
  exempts paper images from hue clustering), `measure` (card geometry).
- **Allowed fix operations**: (c) AR-bandwidth width adjust, (f) `.figure--wide`, (g) asset fix
  (re-crop, swap for a sharper figure from the *same* paper, re-run preprocess). Width changes
  via `.w-NN` utility (b/e) or the sanctioned `style="width:NN%"`.
- **Anti-patterns**: a paper `<img>` carrying neither `data-source` nor `data-asset-id` —
  invisible to asset_check, so it doesn't count toward the ≥2 quota (add both if you mean to run
  the gate); `data-source="paper"` *without* `data-asset-id` (that pair-mismatch is the rule 10
  HARD failure); a wide figure shrunk into a gray
  margin below 65% width (polish FIG/WIDE); a low-res crop where natural_px < 1.5× rendered
  (asset WARN→FAIL); fabricating/“illustrating” a figure not in the paper (rubric ≤3 cap,
  manifest `from_paper` must be false → fails the paper-figure quota).

## hero-figure (`.hero` + `.hero-stage` > img, `landscape_hero` template only)

- **Purpose**: The single dominant visual on the hero template — one large figure / system
  diagram / table that *is* the poster's message. Replaces the framework banner.
- **Allowed variants**: optional `.hero-caption` and one optional `.hero-aside` text block; a
  `.stage-placeholder` is shown only while authoring (must be removed once the real img drops
  in). The hero `<img>` has **no border** (the `.hero-stage` frames it).
- **Required data attributes**: `data-measure-role="hero"` on the `.hero` panel (mutually
  exclusive with `data-measure-role="banner"`). The hero `<img>` carries the same
  `data-source="paper"` + `data-asset-id` contract as any paper figure (asset_check probes the
  hero centerpiece too — the worst image to silently lose).
- **Token usage**: `--bg-card`, `--border-soft`, `--accent` (8u left-bar), `--bg-card-tint`
  (stage gradient → flattened in the ARIS fork), `--bg-emphasis` (`.hero-aside`). Section title
  font-size `calc(var(--fs-7) * …)` is a predefined hero variant (rule 8 calc exception).
- **Inspected by**: `asset` (counts as a paper figure; FIG/BROKEN on the hero img is fatal),
  `polish` (hero img BROKEN check), `measure` (hero bottom must bottom-align with the supporting
  column's last card, spread < 5px), `preflight`, `style`.
- **Allowed fix operations**: (c), (d) (switch templates if hero is the wrong frame),
  (f) hero variants, (g) asset fix.
- **Anti-patterns**: padding the hero with empty space to fill the row (rubric "large empty
  card/column" ≤5 cap; measure spread); putting a border on the hero img; leaving the
  `.stage-placeholder` in the final poster (preflight/polish residue); a hero img that is not
  paper-sourced (asset quota + rubric ≤3).

## eqn (`.eqn`, optional `.eqn .label`)

- **Purpose**: A display-equation block — MathJax-rendered math with an optional uppercase label
  ("CORE EQUATION"). The only sanctioned home for math.
- **Allowed variants**: `.eqn--large` (predefined `font-size: calc(var(--fs-5) * 1.25)` — the
  one calc-on-token variant blessed by IMPLEMENTATION_CONVENTIONS §E.9 and style rule 8/§12.5
  nit 1). No other size variant.
- **Required data attributes**: none. (Math is found by gate via the rendered MathJax SVG, not a
  data attribute.)
- **Token usage**: `--bg-emphasis` (block fill, flat in the fork), `--accent` (3u left-bar),
  `--accent` (`.label` text), `--font-sans` (label). Block font-size `--fs-5`.
- **Inspected by**: `preflight` (bare `<` inside `$…$`, LaTeX residue), `measure`/`polish` (if the
  page intends MathJax but no `<mjx-container>` rendered — CDN block / script error — that is a
  HARD fail at render-settle), `style` (label is sans, size via `--fs-*`). **Note:** posterly has
  *no* equation-box sizing gate — an `.eqn` left mostly empty is **not** auto-caught, so size it
  by eye (the upstream ARIS `EQN/UNDERSIZED` check is not vendored here).
- **Allowed fix operations**: (a) token retune, (c) shorten/split the equation (content
  rebalance), (f) `.eqn--large` to fill an undersized box, (e) global eqn stylesheet (tokens).
- **Anti-patterns**: raw `<` inside math (preflight — MathJax parses it as an HTML tag);
  embedding the equation as a screenshot image instead of MathJax (defeats the MathJax-rendered
  check, inflates PDF, fails the "real text" expectation); a per-equation px font-size override
  (rule 8 HARD); an `.eqn` box left mostly empty (no gate catches this — check by eye).

## callout (`.callout`, variant `.callout.gold`)

- **Purpose**: An accent-filled emphasis strip for a question, theorem, or one-line takeaway —
  the "read this even if you read nothing else" line inside a card.
- **Allowed variants**: `.callout` (solid `--accent`, white text, `<strong>` in gold) and
  `.callout.gold` (solid `--gold`, `--accent-deep` text — the ARIS fork flattens the original
  gold *gradient* to a flat fill per §E.2). No third variant.
- **Required data attributes**: none.
- **Token usage**: `.callout` → `--accent` bg, white text, `--gold` (`<strong>`); `.callout.gold`
  → `--gold` bg, `--accent-deep` text. Font-size `--fs-4`.
- **Inspected by**: `style` (rule 5 — `.callout.gold` must be a flat fill, no `linear-gradient`;
  rule 4 — its accent/gold are the two allowed hue families; rule 1/3 — colors via var),
  `measure` (counts toward card height).
- **Allowed fix operations**: (a), (b) add/remove a callout instance, (c) reword from paper
  source, (f) toggle `.callout` ↔ `.callout.gold`.
- **Anti-patterns**: `linear-gradient` fill (rule 5 — convention is a flat fill; the single most
  common de-gradient regression, hard only if rule 5 is re-enabled); a third color on a callout
  (rule 4 — >2 hue clusters); using a
  callout to introduce a claim not in the paper (Step 6.5 final-HTML overclaim audit).

## result-table (`table.result-table`)

- **Purpose**: A benchmark / comparison table with the "ours" row highlighted in gold and group
  rows / best cells marked. The quantitative payload of a results card.
- **Allowed variants**: row classes `tr.group-row` (section divider row), `tr.ours` (gold
  highlight for our method), cell classes `.method` (left-aligned method name), `.best`
  (accent-colored winning number). These are the defined row/cell modifiers — no others.
- **Required data attributes**: none (it lives inside a `card` which carries the measure role).
- **Token usage**: `thead th` → `--accent` bg / white; `tr.group-row td` → `--bg-emphasis`,
  `--accent-deep`, `--accent` bottom border; `tr.ours td` → `--gold-soft`; `.best` → `--accent`;
  borders → `--border-soft`. Font is the **sans** stack (tables/headers are sans per rule 6),
  size `--fs-3`/`--fs-2`.
- **Inspected by**: `style` (rule 6 — table uses sans; rule 4 — gold-soft + accent are within
  the two hue families; rule 8 — sizes via token), `measure` (height in card), `preflight`.
- **Allowed fix operations**: (a), (c) add/remove rows or edit numbers from the paper/results
  (content rebalance), (e) global table stylesheet (tokens). Switching which row is `.ours` is (c).
- **Anti-patterns**: per-cell inline `style="color:#888"` for the reference row (the posterly
  originals did this; the ARIS fork replaces with `.text-muted`) — rule 2 HARD; numbers that do
  not match the paper/results files (Step 1.5 claim→evidence audit + Step 6.5); a third highlight
  color beyond gold-soft/accent (rule 4).

## keybox (`.keybox` > `.kb-item` × N)

- **Purpose**: A compact 2–4-up strip of headline statistics ("3.2× faster", "92% acc"),
  each a big number over a small caption. The at-a-glance numeric hook. Tiles stretch to equal
  height and **vertically center** their content, so a 1-line tile's number aligns with a
  2-line neighbour's instead of sitting top-ragged (custom tile grids must do the same).
- **Allowed variants**: 2–3 items render on the base `.keybox` (a 3-column grid). **4 items
  REQUIRE the `keybox--4` variant** (`<div class="keybox keybox--4">`, see §`keybox--4` below) to
  switch the grid to 4 columns — without it the 4th tile falls into a near-empty second row (the
  base grid is 3-col, so 4 items lay out 3+1). Whichever you use, the **item count must fill its
  rows**: never ship a keybox whose items leave a half-empty trailing row. Each item is
  `.kb-item > .kb-num + .kb-label`.
- **Required data attributes**: none.
- **Token usage**: `.kb-item` → `--bg-emphasis` bg, `--accent` top-border; `.kb-num` →
  `--accent` (`--fs-6`, sans); `.kb-label` → `--text-secondary` (`--fs-1`, sans).
- **Inspected by**: `style` (rule 6 sans, rule 8 token sizes, rule 4 single accent family,
  **rule 13** — a `keybox--4` used in the markup must have its `.keybox.keybox--4` rule in the
  stylesheet), `polish` (Gate B typography orphans — a trailing `↑ × % ↓` glyph on `.kb-num` that
  could wrap alone must carry `.nowrap`), `measure`.
- **Allowed fix operations**: (a), (b) add/remove the strip, (c) edit stats from results,
  (f) `.nowrap` on an orphan-prone number, or toggle `keybox--4` for a 4-up strip.
- **Anti-patterns**: a lone trailing glyph wrapping to its own line (polish Gate B → add
  `.nowrap`); fabricated stats (claim audit); a per-number color/size override (rules 8/4);
  **4 tiles on the base `.keybox` without `keybox--4`** — they orphan 3+1; **the `keybox--4`
  class in the HTML but its `.keybox.keybox--4` rule dropped from the stylesheet** (a dead class →
  silent fallback to 3 columns → 3+1 orphan; this is a HARD rule-13 failure).

## takeaways-strip (`.takeaways-strip`, landscape templates)

- **Purpose**: A full-width bottom strip of 3–4 one-line takeaways ("Idea / Method / Result /
  Practical") — the 60-second narrative exit. Portrait templates drop it (final card carries
  the conclusion instead). **Optional — use judgment, don't default it on.** Keep it only when
  it earns its place as a genuine exit; if the final column cards already land the conclusion,
  or the strip would just restate the body, **drop the whole block** — a redundant strip is
  worse than none.
- **Allowed variants**: title via `.ts-title` (+ `.num` circle), items via `.ts-item` >
  `.ts-key` + `.ts-text`. Item count 3–4. No other variant.
- **Required data attributes**: `data-measure-role="footer-strip"` (measure positions it between
  body and footer; footer-gap band 30–50 is measured to this strip when present).
- **Token usage**: `--bg-emphasis` (strip bg — flattened from the posterly gradient per §E.2),
  `--border-soft`, `--accent`/`--accent-deep` (title, `.num`, item left-bar, `.ts-key`),
  `--font-sans` (keys), `--font-serif` (text). Sizes `--fs-6`/`--fs-4`/`--fs-3`.
- **Inspected by**: `measure` (footer-gap band, full-width span), `style` (rule 5 — strip bg
  must be flat, rule 6 font pairing), `preflight`.
- **Allowed fix operations**: (a), (b) add/remove the whole strip, (c) reword takeaways from the
  paper, (e) global strip stylesheet (tokens).
- **Anti-patterns**: `linear-gradient` strip background (rule 5 — convention is a flat fill, the de-gradient target; hard only if rule 5 is re-enabled);
  using it on a portrait template where it competes for scarce vertical space (use the final
  conclusion card instead); inventing a takeaway not supported by the poster body (Step 6.5);
  keeping it on by default when it merely restates the body — drop the whole block instead.

## qr-block (`.qr-block` > img + `.qr-label`)

- **Purpose**: A scannable QR pointing at the paper / arXiv / code / project page, with a small
  label. Lives in the header right-block.
- **Allowed variants**: none. The img is either a **local raster** QR or, as a last-resort
  authoring placeholder, an inline SVG QR (one of the two sanctioned inline-SVG uses).
- **Required data attributes**: none for the raster QR. If the QR is the inline-SVG fallback, it
  is exempt from hue clustering (rule 4 exempts QR) but must still be a **local** asset in the
  final poster.
- **Token usage**: `--accent` (border), white background, `--accent` (`.qr-label`, sans).
- **Inspected by**: `style` (rule 4 QR exemption; rule 11 — inline SVG allowed only for
  logo / QR fallback / catalogued structural diagram), `preflight` (warns on a remote `src` — a
  remote QR-service URL hangs `measure`'s networkidle wait and link-rots; the hang then HARD-fails
  at render-settle), verify-final (file size ≤20MB — it checks page count / dimensions / size
  only, **not** remote assets).
- **Allowed fix operations**: (a) token retune (border color), (g) asset fix (regenerate the QR
  locally at ≥2× rendered px).
- **Anti-patterns**: a remote QR-service `src` (preflight warns; the networkidle hang then
  HARD-fails at render-settle, plus link rot); a homemade decorative SVG that is not actually a QR
  (rule 11); a blurry QR below 2× rendered px (no gate checks QR resolution — verify by eye).

## venue-badge (`.venue-badge`, default text identity)

- **Purpose**: The default venue identity in the header left slot — venue / year /
  "POSTER" tag as text. The default is a **text** badge; a venue logo is opt-in — place it
  *above* this text inside `.venue-badge` (see "`logo-row` + venue-badge logo" below).
  Affiliation / lab logos go in `.logo-slot` / `.logo-row`, not here.
- **Allowed variants**: `.vb-venue`, `.vb-year`, `.vb-tag` sub-lines, plus an optional venue
  logo `<img>` placed above them (the "venue-badge logo" of the `logo-row` entry below).
  Affiliation / lab logos use `.logo-slot` instead.
- **Required data attributes**: none on the text badge. A venue logo `<img>` / inline `<svg>`
  placed inside `.venue-badge` (above the text) carries `data-color-exempt="logo"` like any
  logo. (Affiliation / lab logos are the separate `.logo-slot` / `.logo-row` path — right block,
  not this badge.)
- **Token usage**: `--accent-deep` (`.vb-venue`), `--text-secondary` (`.vb-year`), `--accent`
  (`.vb-tag`), `--border-soft` (right divider), `--font-sans`. Sizes `--fs-9`/`--fs-5`/`--fs-1`.
- **Inspected by**: `style` (rule 6 sans, rule 8 token sizes, rule 1 colors as tokens),
  `measure` (header geometry), `preflight`.
- **Allowed fix operations**: (a), (c) edit venue/year text. Adding the official venue logo is
  (b): place an `<img>` (62u; portrait 46u) inside `.venue-badge`, above the text — see
  "`logo-row` + venue-badge logo" below. (Affiliation / lab logos use `.logo-slot` / `.logo-row`
  in the right block, not here.)
- **Anti-patterns**: hardcoding a venue's brand hex inline to "match their logo" (rule 1/2 HARD —
  venue color comes from the opt-in token pack, not inline hex); a *fabricated* venue seal
  instead of an official logo file (the v31 cautionary tale); an inline-SVG venue logo missing
  `data-color-exempt="logo"` (rule 1 — its color literals trip hue clustering).

## logo-slot (`.logo-slot` > img/svg, optional)

- **Purpose**: Optional lab/affiliation logo in the header right-block. The **only** place an
  off-palette color is allowed, via explicit exemption.
- **Allowed variants**: a raster `<img>` logo, or an inline `<svg>` logo. Either way the single
  `.logo-slot` logo is height-matched to the QR so the header does not grow (shipped `--logo-h`:
  85u landscape / 75u portrait). The shorter multi-logo `.logo-row` (68u / 58u) and the
  venue-badge logo (62u / 46u) are separate containers with their own heights — don't read "85u"
  as universal.
- **Required data attributes**: `data-color-exempt="logo"` on the logo element — tells
  `style_check` the off-palette colors inside are sanctioned. It is **load-bearing for an inline
  `<svg>` logo** (its color literals would otherwise trip rule 1, and the inline SVG itself needs
  the rule 11 allowance); a raster `<img>` logo has no color literals in the HTML, so the marker
  is convention there, not a hard gate. Keep it on either kind so the intent is explicit.
- **Token usage**: container only (`--border-soft` if framed); the logo's own colors are exempt.
- **Inspected by**: `style` (rule 1 exemption, rule 2 inline-style exemption for the logo SVG's
  internal markup, rule 11 inline-SVG allowance), `measure` (header geometry).
- **Allowed fix operations**: (b) add/remove the slot, (g) asset fix (swap logo file). Resize via
  the size class (`logo-tall` / `logo-square` / `logo-wide`) or a tokenized variant — never a bare
  inline `style=` on the slot (style rule 2 flags it; the exemption covers only the
  `data-color-exempt="logo"` element itself, not the slot wrapper).
- **Anti-patterns**: a logo *without* `data-color-exempt="logo"` (rule 1 — its colors leak into
  hue clustering, rule 4 fails); an empty `.logo-slot` left in place (adds a stray gap — delete
  the whole div instead); using the exemption to smuggle general decorative color (rule 1 intent
  — exemption is for the logo/seal only).

## footer (`.footer`, role `footer`)

- **Purpose**: The bottom info bar — method name, venue·year, acknowledgements, code repo,
  contact. Closes the poster.
- **Allowed variants**: `.footer .repo` (accent-colored repo/contact spans). No others.
- **Required data attributes**: `data-measure-role="footer"` (measure anchors the footer gap to
  this).
- **Token usage**: `--text-muted` (body), `--accent` (`.repo`), `--accent-deep` (method name),
  `--border-soft` (top border), `--font-sans`. Size `--fs-5`.
- **Inspected by**: `measure` (footer gap to body/takeaways 30–50, full-width span), `style`
  (rule 6 sans, rule 1 colors-as-tokens), `preflight`.
- **Allowed fix operations**: (a), (c) edit footer text, (e) global footer stylesheet (tokens).
- **Anti-patterns**: inline `style="color:var(--accent-deep)"` on the method name (the posterly
  original did this — the fork uses `.text-accent-deep` / a class; rule 2 forbids inline style);
  a remote contact-tracking pixel or remote asset in the footer (verify-final); a long raw repo
  URL / email that overflows or ragged-wraps a **narrow portrait** footer — let the QR carry the
  link and print a short `github.com/org/repo` path (the row already `flex-wrap`s and `.repo`
  breaks long tokens, but a short string is the clean fix). See SKILL Layout pitfall — footer fit.

## Utility classes (the zero-inline-style layer)

These exist so the templates carry **no** `style=` attribute (IMPLEMENTATION_CONVENTIONS §B —
zero-tolerance). They are not "components" but the loop uses them under fix vocabulary (f). They
are catalogued here so style_check rule 2 (no inline style) has a sanctioned alternative for
every former inline use.

| Class group | Effect | Replaces former inline |
|-------------|--------|------------------------|
| `.fs-1 … .fs-9` | `font-size: var(--fs-N)` | `style="font-size: calc(N * var(--u))"` |
| `.mt-1 … .mt-6` | `margin-top: calc(N * var(--u))` | `style="margin-top: …"` |
| `.mb-1 … .mb-4` | `margin-bottom: calc(N * var(--u))` | `style="margin-bottom: …"` |
| `.w-45 … .w-100` (5% steps) | figure `<img>` width | `style="width: NN%"` |
| `.text-secondary` `.text-muted` | secondary/muted text color tokens | `style="color:#888"` |
| `.nowrap` | `white-space: nowrap` | orphan-glyph guard (polish Gate B) |
| `.text-center` | `text-align: center` | `style="text-align:center"` |

The **only** sanctioned `style=` survivors (IMPLEMENTATION_CONVENTIONS §B): the internal markup
of a `data-color-exempt="logo"` element, and `style="width: NN%"` on a `data-source="paper"`
`<img>` (AR width tuning when the value is off the 5% grid).

## Fix vocabulary

Inside the visual-review loop (see `SKILL.md`), **only** these operations are allowed. Every
entry above maps its "Allowed fix operations" to these letters.

| ID | Operation | Constraint |
|----|-----------|------------|
| **(a)** | Change a `:root` **token value** | Token names fixed by IMPLEMENTATION_CONVENTIONS §A; no new tokens, no new hex outside the token block. |
| **(b)** | Swap / delete / add a **whole component instance** | Component must be in this catalog. |
| **(c)** | **Content rebalance** | Move a card across columns; add/remove paper-sourced text; adjust a figure width within the AR gate's band. |
| **(d)** | **Canvas / template reselect** | The upgrade path — pick a different template or retarget the canvas (`templates/README.md` "Picking a template"; `SKILL.md` Step 3 and Step 4 "reselect a smaller canvas"). |
| **(e)** | Global **component stylesheet** change | May reference tokens only; **no new hex**. |
| **(f)** | Toggle a **predefined variant** | `.figure--wide`, `.card--compact`, `.eqn--large`, `.nowrap`, `.callout.gold`, etc. — must already be in this catalog. |
| **(g)** | **Asset fix** | Re-crop, swap for a sharper figure from the *same* paper, re-run `preprocess_figures.py`. |

**Forbidden inside the loop** (DESIGN_FINAL §10, last paragraph): new inline `style=`,
new hex literal, homemade decorative SVG, single-element font-size override.

## New components require a human checkpoint

If a fix genuinely needs a component that is **not** in this catalog, the loop **must stop**.
A new component cannot be born inside the Step 6 visual loop.

The procedure (DESIGN_FINAL §10, final paragraph):

1. **Stop** the visual loop. Do not improvise the element inline.
2. **Human checkpoint (🚦)** — get explicit human approval for the new component.
3. **Add a catalog entry** here in COMPONENTS.md with all seven fields (purpose / variants /
   data attributes / token usage / inspected-by / allowed fix ops / anti-patterns), and add its
   tokenized CSS to the template stylesheet (colors via `var(--…)` only, sizes via `--fs-*`).
4. **Re-run from Step 3** (scaffold + token patch), so the new component passes `preflight` +
   `style` from a clean state before re-entering the layout/visual loop. You may not splice a
   new component into a mid-loop poster and keep going.

This is what keeps the fix loop bounded: the component set is closed during the loop, and only
a human-gated, catalogued, re-run-from-Phase-3 step can extend it.

## Density components (added 2026-06-05, codex-converged; user-checkpointed)

> **Shared guardrail (all components below): no component-local color semantics.**
> Semantic distinction must be conveyed by labels, order, typography, and FACT/DERIVED
> text — never by new hues. Every CSS declaration references `--accent`/`--gold`/neutral
> tokens only. This is what keeps a dense poster from regressing into the 30-color
> "patched dashboard" failure class.

### `equation-stack`
- **Purpose**: 2–4 compact formula rows (e.g. population objective + empirical loss) —
  denser than stacking full-margin `.eqn` blocks.
- **Variants**: none. **Data attributes**: none.
- **Tokens**: inherits `.eqn` tokens; tightened margins/padding only.
- **Inspected by**: style (rule 8 via `.eqn`), measure (height + the MathJax-rendered check).
- **Allowed fix ops**: rebalance (move rows between stack and prose); variant via `.eqn--large` on one row.
- **Anti-patterns**: >4 rows (split into two cards); mixing unrelated equations.

### `eqn-anatomy` (+ `eqn-anatomy--row`)
- **Purpose**: term-by-term anatomy of ONE displayed equation: each `.ea-item` = a pill
  `.ea-tag` (term name) + one-line explanation. 2×2 grid default; `--row` = 1×4.
- **Tokens**: accent family only (tint bg, accent left bar, accent-light tag).
- **Inspected by**: style rule 4 (all tags accent), measure.
- **Allowed fix ops**: token edits; 2×2 ↔ 1×4 variant swap; rebalance text.
- **Anti-patterns**: per-term colors (DPO=blue, δ=green, λ=red is FORBIDDEN); anatomy of
  an equation not displayed on the poster; >4 items.

### `flow-strip`
- **Purpose**: horizontal labeled pipeline (`.step` boxes + `.arrow` glyphs) grounded in
  paper variables, e.g. data pair → implicit reward → shift → penalty → optimum.
- **Variants**: `.step--final` (gold top bar + gold-soft bg) — at most ONE, the endpoint.
- **Tokens**: every step the same accent-light; final step gold-soft.
- **Inspected by**: style rule 4, measure, polish FLEX-BR (no `<br>` in steps — use
  `.step-name` block + text).
- **Allowed fix ops**: step count/text rebalance; token edits.
- **Anti-patterns**: calling it an "Algorithm" when the paper has none (label it
  "Objective flow" / "Loss anatomy"); per-step colors; >6 steps.

### `figure--duo`
- **Purpose**: two sibling paper figures sharing one card and ONE caption (e.g.
  failure-geometry → fix-geometry on the same axes).
- **Contract**: both `<img>` carry `data-source="paper"` + `data-asset-id` + `.w-45`/`.w-50`
  (each 42–48% of the card); combined target 8–12% of body.
- **Inspected by**: asset (provenance + per-figure + total bands), polish FIG gates.
- **Allowed fix ops**: asset fixes (re-crop), width within band, swap member figures.
- **Anti-patterns**: pairing unrelated figures; before/after labels in extra hues (use
  text labels with accent/gold only).

### `result-table` derived column (`th.derived` / `td.derived`)
- **Purpose**: a DERIVED arithmetic column (e.g. Δ = Ours − Baseline) next to verbatim
  paper values; gold-soft background marks "derived, not copied".
- **Contract**: the table caption or setup line MUST state the derivation ("Δ = AuxDPO −
  DPO, derived"). Negative/degrading values use *italic*, never red.
- **Inspected by**: style rule 4 (gold family), content audits (Step 1.5 / 6.5 verify arithmetic).
- **Anti-patterns**: mixing derived and verbatim values in one column; unlabeled derived data.

### `keybox--4`
The 4-column variant of **keybox** — see **§keybox** above for the full contract (purpose,
tokens, inspected-by, fix ops). It switches the base 3-col grid to 4 columns for a 4-up
stat/property strip (params / complexity / loss type / guarantee). The
`.keybox.keybox--4 { grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr) }` rule MUST exist in the stylesheet,
or the class is inert and the 4-tile strip orphans 3+1 (`style` rule 13 hard-fails).
- **Density-specific anti-pattern**: tiles that restate the banner's headline stats verbatim —
  the strip should add *new* at-a-glance numbers, not echo the banner.

### `algo`
- **Purpose**: compact numbered procedure list — **only when the paper itself states an
  explicit algorithm/procedure**. Cite it ("Alg. 1", "the procedure of §4.2").
- **Inspected by**: `style` (token colors, font/size scale), `measure` (aligns as a card),
  content audits (Step 1.5 / 6.5 — the steps must be the paper's, not fabricated).
- **Allowed fix ops**: token edits; step-text rebalance; drop the component if the paper has
  no explicit algorithm to cite.
- **Anti-patterns**: INVENTING steps from prose (the v31 poster fabricated a "5 steps per
  batch" algorithm that was not in the paper — this is the cautionary tale).

### `claim-pills`
- **Purpose**: provenance mini-table (`.cp-id` pill + evidence + `.cp-fact`/`.cp-derived`
  badge) for numeric-heavy posters where every number should trace to a source.
- **Contract**: use only when the poster carries ≥8 distinct numeric claims; badges are
  text (FACT/DERIVED), accent/gold colored — no new hues.
- **Anti-patterns**: pills for trivial claims; turning it into a second results table.

### `logo-row` + venue-badge logo (added 2026-06-05, user-checkpointed)
- **Purpose**: institution logos in the header right block (beside the QR), and the
  official venue logo above the venue-badge text. Sized to pair with the QR
  (logo-row 68u, venue logo 62u; portrait 58u / 46u) — visible from poster distance, never tiny.
- **Contract**: REAL logo files only (user-provided or official sources) — fabricating
  a seal as inline SVG is forbidden (the v31 cautionary tale). Every logo `<img>` should
  carry `data-color-exempt="logo"` (palette-gate exemption — load-bearing for an inline-SVG
  logo, convention for a raster one) and a meaningful `alt`.
- **Tokens**: layout-only CSS; logo artwork colors are exempt by contract.
- **Inspected by**: preflight (file exists); for an inline-SVG logo, style rules 1/11
  (color exemption + inline-SVG allowance).
- **Allowed fix ops**: swap logo file, adjust the row's height token, drop a logo.
- **Anti-patterns**: fabricated/approximated seals; logos so small they read as dirt
  (< ~40u); using the logo row to smuggle decorative graphics.
